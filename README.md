# website_from_your_view
For HacktoberFest, make a Hacksu website for us! We want to see what you would want our site to look like :)


HacktoberFest is an amazing opportunity to contribute to different repos to get a shirt and some stickers from GitHub and DigitalOcean. However, for the code to count we want to contribute some quality code. Therefore, the Hacksu team has created 5 different repos with 5 different skills to add some fun code to. Feel free to add whatever you want to the code to help make it better! Keep in mind that we control the repos and can see what you gets change so be cool :)


For this repo, it is CSS, HTML, and JS! Hacksu has a website that we try to adjust every year. For this project, we want to see what you think the site should look like. Make a CSS, HTML, and JS website that represents Hacksu. We cannot wait to see what you come up with! :)
